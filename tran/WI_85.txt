The articles which Mrs Bohl has had the kindness
to lend us for our housekeeping will be returned
by Mr Hall in the course of few days.
Permit me my dear Sir, once more to express
..........
my deep sense of the attentions I have received
from yourself & Mrs Bohl during my sojourn
in Port S. Marys; I feel more sensible of these from
the frank and cordial manner in which they
have been shewn, and from the little importance
you yourselves seen to attach to such unusual
acts of kindness
With my kindest respects to Mrs Bohl-
Iam my dear Sir
with very great regard & esteem
Yours obliged friend
Washington Irving
John Nicolas Bohl, Esq.
