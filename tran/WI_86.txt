London, Sept. 29th 1829.
My dear Sir,
You have no doubt heard before this of the
sudden change in my situation, and how, from
being a loitering author, dreaming in the Alhambra,
I was suddenly hurried away to the stir and bustle
of diplomatic life in London. In my new capacity
of Secretary of the Legation I now call upon you for
assistance. You must be aware that the table enters
largely into Diplomacy, and it is important that 
a minister, above all other things, should have good
wine. I have pledged myself to Mr. McLane
(the minister) through your aid, to procure him
a cask of old Sherry, that should carry sound
argument in every glass- some  such liquor as
that with which Lady Macbeth undertook to
..........
convince the pages of King Duncan. Will you
enable me to redeem my pledge, by shipping a
cask of choice generous old wine. I know you
to have an admirable taste in this as well as
in other things of high practical nature. The
wine may be consigned to Col Thomas
Aspinwall, American Consul London, and the
amount drawn for; or it will be paid to any
London Banker you may appoint.
Present my kind remembrances to Mrs Böhl
and likewise to the Marchioness of Arco hermoso
when you write to her. I have the manuscript
of the latter ## in my possession with the
intention, when I can find leisure, of preparing
..........
something from it for the press; for I really think
independent of the great literary merit of the
manuscript,there are views of national character
in it highly calculated to do good.
I write in extreme haste, which must excuse
my brevity. If I can be of ane service to you
in London, my dear Sir, I beg you will command
me; you cannot do me a greater favour.
